# This is my TypeScript Repository

## TypeScript Basics
### Variable Declarations
```ts
let thisIsANumber: number = 1;
let thisIsAString: string = "Diego";
const constant: "constant" = "constant";
let thisIsAnAny;
thisIsAnAny = 2;
thisIsAnAny = "Enrique";
```
### Arrays & Tuples
```ts
// Array and Tuples declarations
let arr1: number[] = [];
let arr2: string[] = [];
let arr3: any[] = [];

let array: number[] = [];
array.push( 1 );
array.push( 2 );

//This is not allowed because is not a number, it is a string rather.
array.push( "abc" );

// Even if we declare an array with a value, the type of that 
// value is going to be the one the array is going to take.

1 typeof = Number

let array2 = [1];
array2.push( 2 );
array2.push( 3 );

// This is not allowed because our array2 cointains number values
array.push( "def" );

let tuple: [ number, string, string, number ] = [
  123,
  "Lourdes Col√≥n",
  "Villa Lourdes",
  321
];

// This is going to throw an error because a tuple cannot be reassigned
tuple = [ 1,2,3 ];

// We can do this, because our tuple can receive numbers and strings
tuple.push( 5,4,3,2,1 );

const tuple2 = [ 7, 8 ];
const tuple3: [ number, number ] = [ 7, 8 ];
```
### Object Types & Interfaces
```ts
// This is how we can declare an object
let obj: { houseNumber: number ; streetName: string };
obj = {
  streetName: "Manuel Enrique Araujo"
  houseNumber: 22
};

// When using the question mark, we are saying that object value
// is optional to use. So there is no problem if we no declare it
let obj2: { houseNumber: number ; streetName?: string };
obj2: {
  houseNumber: 22,
  streeName: "",
  // We cannot do this because x is not declared above in its declaration
  x: 145
};
```
